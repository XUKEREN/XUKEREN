## About  
I am a Ph.D. candidate in [the Epidemiology PhD Program, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California](https://keck.usc.edu/). Advised by [Dr. Adam de Smith](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/adam-de-smith/), as a Bioinformatician and Genetic Epidemiologist, my research focuses on variant discovery in human DNA sequencing data and (epi)genome-wide association analysis to better understand the genetic and epigenetic risk factors of hematological malignancies, such as child acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Prior to joining USC, I completed M.P.H degree in Epidemiology at [the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/) and B.S. degree in Pharmacy in Shanghai, China, and I worked as a statistician at [the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center](https://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/).

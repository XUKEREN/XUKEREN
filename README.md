I am a Bioinformatics Scientist at Tempus Labs, with a PhD in Epidemiology from the Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, where I studied variant discovery in human DNA sequencing data and (epi)genome-wide association analysis to better understand the genetic and epigenetic risk factors of hematological malignancies, such as child acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma. I completed MPH degree in Epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and BS degree in Pharmacy in Shanghai, China. I am interested in genomics data science and data visualization. My curriculum vitae can be found [here :open_file_folder:](https://xukeren.rbind.io/cv/cv.pdf).

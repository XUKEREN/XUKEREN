I am a Bioinformatician working at [Tempus Labs](https://www.tempus.com/). I obtained my Ph.D. in [the Epidemiology PhD Program, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California](https://keck.usc.edu/), advised by [Dr. Adam de Smith](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/adam-de-smith/). My Ph.D. research focuses on variant discovery in human DNA sequencing data and (epi)genome-wide association analysis to better understand the genetic and epigenetic risk factors of hematological malignancies, such as child acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma. I completed M.P.H degree in Epidemiology at [the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/) and B.S. degree in Pharmacy in Shanghai, China. My curriculum vitae can be found [here :open_file_folder:](https://xukeren.rbind.io/cv/cv.pdf).

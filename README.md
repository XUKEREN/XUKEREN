I am a Bioinformatician and Genetic Epidemiologist, and my Ph.D. research focuses on variant discovery in human DNA sequencing data and (epi)genome-wide association analysis to better understand the genetic and epigenetic risk factors of hematological malignancies, such as child acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma. I obtained my Ph.D. in the Epidemiology PhD Program, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California.
